# balloon_pop_bot

There are total 3 motors in the bot and for driving 3 motors we need two motor drivers.
Two motors(left and right) for driving the bot.
One motor(weapon) for driving the motorized weapon.

The bot can be controlled by any kind of commercial transmitter and receiver.
The signals send by transmitter is received by the receiver and fed into the arduino for controlling the bot.
The transmitter I used was READIOLINK AT10.
You can use any commercial transmitter.

The circuit was designed in a cad called DIPTRACE.
I have attached the pdf of the diagram also.


REQUIREMENTS:
  - any commercial tarsmitter, receiver
  - ardunio 
  - motor driver x2
  - motors x3
  - battery
