# balloon_pop_bot

Hi,
I designed this bot for a competition in which two bots go after each others ballons in the arena to win
There are total 3 motors in the bot and for driving 3 motors we need two motor drivers
Two motors(left and right according to code) for driving the bot
One motor(weapon according to code) for driving the motorized weapon

The bot can be controlled by any kind of commercial transmitter and receiver
The signals send by transmitter is received by the receiver and fed into the arduino for controlling the bot
The transmitter I used was READIOLINK AT10
You can use any commercial transmitter


REQUIREMENTS:
  - any commercial tarsmitter, receiver
  - ardunio 
  - motor driver(2)
  - motors(2 or 3 --one can be extra for weapon)
  - battery
